# Messages to some domains are delivered to virtual mailboxes on this server:
jkristian.com  :
.jkristian.com :
w6jmk-postoffice.local.mesh :

# Messages to some domains are relayed directly to servers on the mesh:
.local.mesh smtp:
# There are no MX records for these domains, consequently
# Postfix treats the email domain as a computer name,
# and connects to the SMTP server on that computer.

# All other messages are relayed to a server in the public Internet:
* smtp:[mta1.jkristian.com]:587
# The brackets [] say 'don't look for MX records'
