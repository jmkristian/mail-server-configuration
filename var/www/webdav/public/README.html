    This is a place to share files. Anyone can read any file.
  </p><p>
    You can browse files starting at the URL path <a href="/files/">http:/files/</a>.
    These URLs are useful for sharing files with other people.
    For example, you can paste a URL into an email message, and
    the message recipients can click the link to browse or download the file or folder.
  </p><p>
    You can access files via FTP (port 21), WebDAV on HTTP port 2121
    or the web-based UI at <a href="/edit-files">http:/edit-files</a> .
    You can log in with the username "anonymous" and any password.
    If you log in with any other username, you can upload files
    into the folder whose name is your username.
    To get a username, you can <a href="/user/selfadd" target="_blank">create an account</a>.
  </p><p>
    You can access files in Windows File Explorer by applying "Map Network Drive" to
    a folder name like http://hostname:2121 (the WebDAV server).
    <em>But</em> this won't work until you
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13413914/how-to-enable-basic-authentication-for-webdav-on-windows-8">set this registry key = 2</a>
    (using regedit):
    <pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel</pre>
    The value 2 enables Windows to send a cleartext password via HTTP.
    This WebDAV server requires a cleartext password,
    because the FCC forbids sending encrypted data over amateur radio.
